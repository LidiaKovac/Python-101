# Python-101
Hi! My name is Lidia ðŸ‘‹

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 
This repo is part of a "series" of 101s. 

I am a MERN Stack developer, recently graduated from Strive School. This means I have knowledge of MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of some autonomous exploration, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page. 

This is the repository for the very basics of Python. If I like it, I will likely do more projects with it and dive deeper. 

### Update

For now, I am loving the language! I want to dive deeper, but I don't really know where to start. I made a rock paper scissor program that runs inside the terminal, but I want something more. 

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!
